Program Description:
This program calculates the factorial of a given number. It prompts the user to input a non-negative integer and then computes the factorial of that number using a recursive function.

---

Logical Steps:  
1. Prompt the user to input a non-negative integer.
2. Validate the user input to ensure it is a non-negative integer.
3. Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial.
4. Call the recursive function with the user input.
5. Display the result to the user.

---

Variables:  
1.  num: The non-negative integer input by the user.
2.  result: The calculated factorial of the input number.

---

Functions: 
1. Function Name: factorial
   Description: Computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion.  
   Parameters: n (int): The non-negative integer for which the factorial is to be calculated.  
   Returns: int: The factorial of the input number.
